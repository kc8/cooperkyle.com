                    Using some temperature sensors and resistance sensors we are able to measure different environmental factors in a garden.
                    Using a Raspberry Pi with sensors we can monitor things like temperature, soil moisture and more. 
                    The data gets sent a real time database were its then updated on the website below.

                    <p>
                        After running this site for a few years, many of the sensors have become warn out and no longer function properly.
                        Another issue is that Raspberry Pis have become almost impossible to obtain, and so the site is not longer live

                    This is a Python wrapper for the PiAware/dump1090 ADBS library. 
                    PiAware uses a Raspberry Pi, Antenna, SDR and some filtering to track flights. 
                    All aircraft in the USA must transmit an ADBS single, which is then picked up by the Pi. 
                    This module built in Python requests information from the host Raspberry Pi via a RESTful request. 
                    Returning a list of all aircraft the Raspberry Pi (PiAware) is reading.

                        This project is not longer live due to the host raspberry pi dying and not replacements being available

                    A program using Message Passing Interface (MPI) with C. 
                    MPI is designed to create parallel processes in C allowing for the exchange of information between the processes. 
                    This project uses the MPI_Scatter and MPI_Gather routines to distribute data. 
                    My program asks the user for an amount of integers N, randomly creates the integers and adds them to an array. 
                    The array is then divided amongst N subsets (default is 4) and then each array is sent to a process. 
                    The process calculates the total for the sub set then sends the result back to the main process were the main process totals the rest of the arrays. 
                    This project taught the uses of pointers with malloc and alloc, parallel processing, and arrays and helped develop better understand the C ecosystem.
