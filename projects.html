                    Using some temperature sensors and resistance sensors we are able to measure different environmental factors in a garden.
                    Using a Raspberry Pi with sensors we can monitor things like temperature, soil moisture and more. 
                    The data gets sent a real time database were its then updated on the website below.

            This is a Python wrapper for the PiAware/dump1090 ADBS library. 
            PiAware uses a Raspberry Pi, an Antenna, SDR and some filtering to track flights. 
            All aircraft in the USA must transmit an ADBS single, which is then picked up by the Pi. 
            The module that built in Python requests information from the Raspberry Pi via a RESTful request. 
            Returning a list of all aircraft the PiAware is reading.

                A program using Message Passing Interface (MPI) with C. 
                MPI is designed to create parallel processes in C allowing for the exchange of information between the processes. 
                This project uses the MPI_Scatter and MPI_Gather routines to distribute data. 
                My program asks the user for an amount of integers N, randomly creates the integers and adds them to an array. 
                The array is then divided amongst N subsets (default is 4) and then each array is sent to a process. 
                The process calculates the total for the sub set then sends it back to the main process were the main process totals the rest of the arrays. 
                This project taught the uses of pointers with malloc and alloc, parallel processing, and arrays and helped develop my skills in C.
